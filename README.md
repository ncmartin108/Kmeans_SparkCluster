# Kmeans_SparkCluster
This is an assignment for CS496 Cloud Computing. This program is saved on a Jupyter notebook and its goal is to use Spark on AWS to create kmeans clustering on a set of data.
The data comes from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge. Specifically, we are using Pyspark to read metadata.csv from this data set to gather the paper titles and abstracts only.
